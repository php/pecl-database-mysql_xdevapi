                With X DevAPI we can connect directly to a specific session by a call to getSession

		Details: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/x-devapi-userguide/en/xsession-vs-node-session.html

                For using the X DevAPI a MySQL Server with enabled X Plugin is required.
		The X Plugin is part of MySQL 5.7.12. For instructions about installation and configuration
		please refer to the MySQL documentation at:

                http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/document-store-setting-up.html

		The XDevAPI extension for PHP export the functions used to initiate the connection,
		the syntax is: mysql_xdevapi\<name of the function>

		Where mysql_xdevapi is the 'namespace' where those functions are declared.

		If the connection failed the function will raise an exception (invalid user name or password, &c)
