MySQL X DevAPI for PHP
======================

This PHP Extension provides MySQL's X DevAPI. The X DevAPI is a new CRUD-style
API for accessing MySQL as a Document Store. It is based on the MySQL 8's X
protocol and unifies JSON document and table access, and it includes SQL
support. The API features a popular fluent interface style and aims to be
particularly easy to use yet powerful. The X DevAPI sees wide cross product
support. Developers can use the same syntax and rely on the existence of
virtually the same feature set in may products they work with on a day to
day basis.

The X DevAPI combines elements of the relational database model with elements
of storing JSON documents. Working with schemaless data serialized in JSON has
become very popular in recent years. Schema flexibility allows data-first
development models. For example, application developers do not need to define
the very details of the data to be stored before it can be saved, customers
can model applications using an iterative approach, defining the details along
the way when they work with the developers. In other areas a mode-first
development model may fit the brief better. The X DevAPI supports both working
with schemaful relational tables and schemaless collections of JSON documents.

The X DevAPI abstracts the notion of a connection to that of a session. A
session encapsulates physical connections. This concept is crucial for
any environment where the creation, selection and life span of a physical
connection shall not be a concern of the application developer.
